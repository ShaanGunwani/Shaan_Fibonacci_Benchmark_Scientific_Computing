# Shaan_Fibonacci_Benchmark_Scientific_Computing

I will be comparing the time complexity as well as the space complexity gleaned from the algorithm's results by utilizing the iterative approach and the recursive approach to the Fibonacci sequence.

Test 

We have to do a test to see whether the inputs will give out correct outputs. 
We can do/run this by entering the below command in the terminal :- 
make; ./main_test.out

Then, you should see the below image as the output :-

So, now we can see that the correct output is being generated.

Benchmark

We are doing the benchmarking to compare the time complexity and the space complexity of the iterative approach and the recursive approach.

We can start with the time complexity.

I made N=10 for both the approaches. The purpose is to check the time execution. 

We can input the command below in the terminal to run it :- 
make time 

Then, the output will be displayed :-

Space Complexity 

You can input the commands below to run the space complexity :- 
make space
./main_b_space_iterative.out

make space
./main_b_space_recursive.out

For Iterative you can see that the memory utilized is
